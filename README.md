# CSS Animation Demo

This is a small interactive gallery I created while completing the LinkedIn Learning course **CSS: Animation** by Val Head. Rather than recreating the course samples, I applied concepts in a more intentional way—building UI-style animations, motion patterns, and small interaction elements.

## ✔️ What it demonstrates
- CSS keyframe animations  
- transitions and hover states  
- transforms (scale, rotate, translate, 3D perspective)  
- animation timing functions and easing (`cubic-bezier`)  
- animation-delay and `animation-fill-mode`  
- animation-direction and sequencing  
- `steps()` timing function (typing effect)  
- infinite/looping animation patterns  
- `animation-play-state`  
- chained multi-stage keyframe animations  
- motion path animation using:
  - `offset-path`
  - `offset-distance`
  - `offset-rotate`
- inline SVG animation (outline + fill transition)  
- variable font animation using `font-variation-settings`

## 💡 Why I built it
I wanted to show that I completed the course and could **independently apply the concepts** in a way that feels more like real UI design: clear, intentional, reusable, and modular.

It’s also a personal motion design reference for small interaction patterns and micro-animations I can reuse later.
